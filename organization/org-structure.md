# Organizational Overview

Ayka Secure Technologies GmbH operates as a cloud-native SaaS startup providing regulatory compliance enablement solutions to EU-based organizations.

The company maintains a lean organizational structure designed for agility, accountability, and clear separation of governance responsibilities.

## Governance Separation

Ayka maintains functional separation between:

- Business management
- Information security governance
- Technical cloud operations
- Compliance management

The Information Security function reports directly to executive leadership to ensure independence in risk decisions and compliance oversight.

## Role Consolidation (Startup Model)

Due to startup size, certain individuals may hold multiple roles. However:

- Information Security oversight remains independent from direct revenue ownership.
- Risk acceptance decisions require executive approval.
- Compliance documentation ownership is formally assigned.

This structure ensures ISO 27001 governance principles are maintained despite organizational scale.
