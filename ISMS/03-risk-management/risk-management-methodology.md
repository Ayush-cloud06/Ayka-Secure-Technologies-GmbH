# 1. Purpose

This document defines the structured methodology used by Ayka Secure Technologies GmbH to identify, assess, treat, and monitor information security risks within the scope of the ISMS.

The objective is to ensure risks are:

- Systematically identified  
- Consistently evaluated  
- Appropriately treated  
- Regularly reviewed  
- Properly documented  

---

# 2. Scope of Risk Management

Risk management applies to:

- Information assets
- Cloud infrastructure
- Identity and access systems
- SaaS platform components
- Regulatory obligations (GDPR, ISO 27001, TISAX, etc.)
- Third-party service providers
- Personnel and operational processes

All risks within the defined ISMS scope must follow this methodology.

---

# 3. Risk Identification

Risks are identified through:

- Asset inventory review
- Threat modeling workshops
- Architecture reviews
- Incident analysis
- Change management activities
- Internal audit findings
- Regulatory gap assessments
- Supplier assessments

Each risk must include:

- Asset affected
- Threat description
- Vulnerability exploited
- Potential impact

Risk statement format:

> “There is a risk that [threat] exploits [vulnerability] affecting [asset], leading to [impact].”

# 4. Risk Assessment Criteria

## 4.1 Likelihood Scale

| Score | Likelihood Description |
|--------|------------------------|
| 1 | Rare (Highly unlikely) |
| 2 | Unlikely |
| 3 | Possible |
| 4 | Likely |
| 5 | Almost Certain |

---

## 4.2 Impact Scale

Impact is assessed across:

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability
- Regulatory compliance
- Financial impact
- Reputational damage

| Score | Impact Description |
|--------|--------------------|
| 1 | Negligible |
| 2 | Minor |
| 3 | Moderate |
| 4 | Major |
| 5 | Critical |

---

## 4.3 Risk Calculation

Risk Score = Likelihood × Impact  

| Score Range | Risk Level |
|-------------|------------|
| 1–5 | Low |
| 6–10 | Medium |
| 11–15 | High |
| 16–25 | Critical |

---

# 5. Risk Treatment Options

Each identified risk must be assigned one of the following treatment strategies:

1. Risk Mitigation  
   - Implement technical or organizational controls  
   - Reduce likelihood and/or impact  

2. Risk Avoidance  
   - Eliminate the activity causing the risk  

3. Risk Transfer  
   - Transfer risk through insurance or contractual agreements  

4. Risk Acceptance  
   - Formally accept risk if within tolerance threshold  

All accepted risks must be formally approved by executive management.

---

# 6. Risk Acceptance Criteria

Ayka Secure Technologies GmbH defines:

- Low risks → May be accepted by CISO  
- Medium risks → Must have mitigation plan  
- High risks → Mitigation mandatory  
- Critical risks → Immediate treatment required  

No critical risk may remain untreated.

---

# 7. Risk Register

All risks are recorded in the centralized Risk Register including:

- Risk ID
- Description
- Asset
- Threat
- Vulnerability
- Likelihood score
- Impact score
- Risk score
- Risk owner
- Treatment plan
- Review date
- Status

The Risk Register is reviewed:

- Quarterly
- After major changes
- After security incidents
- During management review

---

# 8. Risk Ownership

Each risk must have an assigned Risk Owner responsible for:

- Monitoring risk status
- Ensuring treatment implementation
- Reporting to management

Risk ownership aligns with defined roles in the Roles & Responsibilities document.

---

# 9. Review and Continuous Improvement

Risk management effectiveness is reviewed through:

- Internal audits
- Management review meetings
- Incident trend analysis
- Control effectiveness evaluations

The methodology itself is reviewed annually.

---

# 10. Documentation and Evidence

All risk-related activities must be documented and retained as ISMS records, including:

- Risk assessments
- Treatment decisions
- Approval records
- Review logs
- Management acceptance records

Records are retained for a minimum of 5 years.

---

# 11. Integration with Other Processes

This methodology integrates with:

- Change Management
- Incident Management
- Access Control Governance
- Supplier Management
- Business Continuity Planning

Risk management is a continuous process, not a one-time activity.
